%%%% Brace Library
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% These commands draw braces between two tikzmarks,
% no matter which one is the rightmost, and include
% a node midway the brace, to write a comment.
% This command also creates a new node
% whose name is the concat of the names of beginning and ending nodes.
% Into styles there can be styles for: decoration, brace and comment.
%
% Based on some tips from these QAs:
